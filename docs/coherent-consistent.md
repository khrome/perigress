coherent + consistent
=====================

The output data is "coherent". By that we mean: for [well known regexs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/well-known-regex), the generated data is consistent between fields in an object, in addition lists are coherent with individual item displays( they have the same data, both in a list and when requested directly) and, last, the data is consistent, meaning the same request will always generate the same output(excepting behavior changes between major versions).
