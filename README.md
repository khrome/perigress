Perigress (Unified)
==================

A medium for contract based development.

The original repository for [@perigress/perigress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@perigress/perigress), and now a convenience binding for the combined library. This started as [an experiment](https://github.com/khrome/joinerator) with [joi](https://joi.dev/) to see if it were possible to generate a reasonable, [coherent + consistent](https://github.com/khrome/perigress/blob/master/docs/coherent-consistent.md) data, but then I realized using [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) could support joi **and** many other features and pipelines.

You can find documentation at [@perigress/perigress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@perigress/perigress).
